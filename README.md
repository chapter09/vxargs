vxargs
======
vxargs is inspired by xargs and pssh. It provides the parallel versions of any arbitrary command, including ssh, rsync, scp, wget, curl, and whatever. One reason to use it is to control a large set of machines in the wide-area network. 


* the original version is from [http://vxargs.sourceforge.net](http://vxargs.sourceforge.net)

###change log
* [19 January, 2014] now in the input file, we can support '-p PORT USERNAME@HOSTNAME'
